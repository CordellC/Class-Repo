							<br>
							<br>
						O'Brien is a gifted chef who grew up watching his grandmother cook delicious meals for years. Watching her definitely inspired his love for good food. His skills were later cultivated through observing and learning from other outstanding cooks such as his friend, Albert Lanksky, his sister Cherry O'Brien, and his mother, Lillian O'Brien.
							<br>
							<br>
						He grew up in the Suburbs of San Antonio. So, it was important to him to open up a business inside of the community that shaped him into the man that he is today. He really wanted to give his friends and neighbors a restaurant that they could be proud to have in their possession.
							<br>
							<br>
						Before O'Brien became an entrepreneur, he served as a Probation Officer for 7 years. O'Brien loved being a servant of the law, but cooking has always been in his blood. Thus, he had to pursue his dream of opening a restaurant.
							<br>
						He attended St. Philips College where he earned a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Sociology and Criminology in 1990.
							<br>
							<br>
						O'Brien is married to Allison Parrson. He is also the proud father of 2 children, Alexander and Daniel.
